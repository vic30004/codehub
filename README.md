An online community for developers, recruiters, and tech enthusiasts to collaborate and build something special

## Objective 

We wanted to create a MERN stack application that serves as a learning and networking resource for developers, recruiters, and tech enthusiasts.  To create a platform like this, it will require
user authentification for individuals to sign up and create profiles.  Once the user is logged in, they will have access to additional benefits to our platform.

## Code Structure

Due to the significant size of this project, folder structure was crucial to maintain overall organiziation.  Without getting to the exact specifics, our client folder serves the React app.  The client folder is composed of our pages, components, assets, and API calls.  The root server.js file initializes our back-end.  It communicates with the our API routes, controllers, client, and models.
